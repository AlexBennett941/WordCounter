# WordCounter
The program originally went through a text file and counted the vowels that came through it. For the changes I made I chose three letters, v, j, and t.
I added individual counters for each of these letters. I also added a counter that added all three of the new specified characters that would display
the sum of all three. As well I added a counter for all three of those letters + the vowels. Lastly I also added a counter for every letter that was
unspecified in the program.
